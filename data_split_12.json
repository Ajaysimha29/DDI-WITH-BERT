More recently, longer-acting forms of growth hormone were developed to improve patient adherence and thus, improve the therapeutic efficacy of treatment.[A241485] Somatrogon was produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells using recombinant DNA technology. It is a chimeric product generated by fusing three copies of the C-terminal peptide (CTP), or 28 carboxy-terminal residues, from the beta chain of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to the N-terminus and C-terminus of human growth hormone.[A241515,L39362] The glycosylation and the presence of CTPs in the protein sequence prolongs the half-life of somatrogon and allows its once-weekly dosing.[L39362]\r\n\r\nIn October 2021, Health Canada approved somatrogon under the market name NGENLA as the long-term treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to an inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone caused by growth hormone deficiency, marking Canada as the first country to approve this drug.[L39060] It is available as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection.[L39080]","enzymes":null,"type":"biotech","cas-number":"1663481-09-1","sequences":">Somatrogon amino acid sequence\nSSSSKAPPPSLPSPSRLPGPSDTPILPQFPTIPLSRLFDNAMLRAHRLHQLAFDTYQEFE\nEAYIPKEQKYSFLQNPQTSLCFSESIPTPSNREETQQKSNLELLRISLLLIQSWLEPVQF\nLRSVFANSLVYGASDSNVYDLLKDLEEGIQTLMGRLEDGSPRTGQIFKQTYSKFDTNSHN\nDDALLKNYGLLYCFRKDMDKVETFLRIVQCRSVEGSCGFSSSSKAPPPSLPSPSRLPGPS\nDTPILPQSSSSKAPPPSLPSPSRLPGPSDTPILPQ","targets":null,"unii":"6D848RA61B","protein-binding":"There is no information available.","fda-label":null,"clearance":"Following subcutaneous administration of 0.66 mg\/kg\/wk in pediatric patients with growth hormone deficiency, the clearance was 0.0336 L\/h\/kg.[L39362]","atc-codes":"ANTERIOR PITUITARY LOBE HORMONES AND ANALOGUES Somatropin and somatropin agonists SYSTEMIC HORMONAL PREPARATIONS, EXCL.

Activation of JAK2 and phosphorylation of both JAK2 and GHR initiates the recruits various signalling proteins and facilitates multiple signalling pathways responsible for growth and

To date, the exposure-response and time course pharmacodynamic relationships of margetuximab remain incompletely characterized. Although generally well-tolerated, margetuximab carries a risk of infusion-related reactions, including symptoms such as fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headache, tachycardia, hypotension, and cutaneous manifestations such as a rash or urticaria; infusion reactions may require alterations to the infusion or, in serious reactions, discontinuation.[L27986]","msds":null,"description":"The HER2 oncoprotein, the product of the human _ERBB2_\/mouse _neu_ genes, is a member of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases that includes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Of the various subtypes of breast cancer, HER2-positive breast cancer is characterized by _ERBB2_ overexpression, a higher grade, a more aggressive phenotype, and a worse prognosis compared to HER2-negative cancer.[A225751] The introduction of [trastuzumab] improved patient outcomes in HER2-positive breast cancer, but notably depended substantially on polymorphisms in the FcÎ³RIIIA\/CD16A receptor, whereby low affinity 158F CD16A variants are associated with shorter progression-free survival and worse patient outcomes.[A225756]\r\n\r\nMargetuximab (formerly MGAH22) is an Fc-engineered human\/mouse chimeric anti-HER2 IgG1Îº monoclonal antibody derived from the same mouse 4D5 clone that [trastuzumab] is derived from and is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) culture.[A225751, A225756, A225766, A191829, L27986] Margetuximab binds to the same epitope on the HER2 extracellular domain and induces the same effects as [trastuzumab]. However, due to its modified Fc region, margetuximab binds with higher affinity to both CD16A variants and exhibits weaker binding to the inhibitory CD32B Fc receptor, resulting in more efficient antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and increased efficacy compared to [trastuzumab].[A225751, A225756, A225766, A191829, L27986]\r\n\r\nMargextuximab was granted FDA approval on December 16, 2020, and is currently marketed under the trademark MARGENZAâ\u201E¢ by MacroGenics, Inc.[L27986]","enzymes":null,"type":"biotech","cas-number":"1350624-75-7","sequences":null,"targets":"BE0000511","unii":"K911R84KEW","protein-binding":null,"fda-label":null,"clearance":"Margetuximab has a geometric mean (%CV) clearance of 0.22 (24%) L\/day.

EGFR\/HER2 dimerization promotes EGFR recycling and prolonged signalling while HER2\/HER3 dimerization potently stimulates the downstream PI3K\/AKT pathway; HER2 homodimerization directly activates the RAS\/MAPK pathway and indirectly activates the PI3K\/AKT pathway.[A225751]\r\n\r\nThe prototypical anti-HER2 therapy is [trastuzumab], a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds the HER2 extracellular domain. [Trastuzumab] works through several mechanisms: [trastuzumab] binding induces receptor internalization and c-CBL-mediated HER2 degradation; effector cell binding to the Fc region of [trastuzumab] through CD16A results in antibody-mediated cell-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC); finally, [trastuzumab] binding dampens HER2 activation, phosphorylation, and subsequent downstream oncogenic signalling.[A225751]\r\n\r\nDespite demonstrated clinical efficacy, [trastuzumab] efficacy is dependent on polymorphisms in CD16A. Effector cells such as natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages bind to mAbs through Fc receptors such as CD16A (FcÎ³RIIIA), CD32A (FcÎ³RIIA), and the inhibitory CD32B (FcÎ³RIIB).[A225751, A225756, A225766] CD16A has both high affinity (with valine at position 158; 158V) and low affinity (158F) variants; patients heterozygous or homozygous for the 158F variant have poorer responses to [trastuzumab].[A225751, A225756, A225766] Margetuximab is derived from the same mouse 4D5 clone as [trastuzumab], but with a modified (MGFc0264) Fc region encoding five amino acid substitutions (L235V, F243L, R292P, Y300L, and P396L) to alter Fc receptor binding.[A225756, A191829, L27986] Comparatively, margetuximab exhibits increased binding to both the high affinity (K<sub>D<\/sub> of 89 nM vs 415 nM) and low affinity (K<sub>D<\/sub> of 161 nM vs 1059 nM) CD16A receptors and decreased binding to the inhibitory CD32B receptor (K<sub>D<\/sub> of 437 nM vs 52 nM).[A225756, L27986] This, in turn, increases ADCC and anti-tumour effect, especially in cells expressing lower levels of HER2 and in patients with the lower affinity 158F CD16A variant.[A225756, A225766]","drug-interactions":"DB05209 DB14905 DB06474 DB09381 DB06647 DB11959 DB09052 DB13259 DB12034 DB11857 DB14039 DB12023 DB06305 DB15898 DB14877 DB00814 DB11604 DB12344 DB13886 DB05232 DB14811 DB11884 DB11685 DB11746 DB15118 DB01086 DB14997 DB12815 DB12235 DB06602 DB12053 DB14012 DB09035 DB14891 DB13017 DB01075 DB00108 DB06810 DB06599 DB06310 DB14864 DB09105 DB12520 DB12396 DB05797 DB04978 DB05656 DB06557 DB12274 DB11680 DB13140 DB06607 DB15443 DB00281 DB14897 DB13578 DB00028 DB12104 DB15001 DB12261 DB12849 DB13954 DB12826 DB12844 DB04962 DB11866 DB12205 DB12498 DB11715 DB00012 DB00098 DB11502 DB11621 DB16385 DB00113 DB12246 DB15627 DB00002 DB04949 DB00385 DB13535 DB01257 DB12335 DB00890 DB04901 DB11976 DB12119 DB09045 DB14952 DB00054 DB05111 DB08894 DB15626 DB16225 DB12698 DB13073 DB08870 DB11731 DB14776 DB12410 DB11771 DB05304 DB12893 DB15090 DB09107 DB16755 DB05437 DB14919 DB15135 DB05459 DB14211 DB12363 DB15865 DB12943 DB12584 DB15899 DB09369 DB00977 DB12891 DB15415 DB05276 DB11914 DB16170 DB00072 DB11988 DB06371 DB11674 DB15045 DB01269 DB06550 DB16355 DB06322 DB11616 DB13976 DB15089 DB13979 DB11834 DB05679 DB05006 DB00297 DB09318 DB14843 DB12589 DB06606 DB11756 DB15160 DB14907 DB12734 DB15022 DB15277 DB15172 DB11597 DB00783 DB12530 DB16265 DB00065 DB15718 DB05892 DB13386 DB12532 DB12089 DB09303 DB08904 DB12487 DB14959 DB12917 DB12845 DB06192 DB01161 DB00043 DB15628 DB12976 DB09559 DB01357 DB09033 DB09345 DB11826 DB14004 DB09009 DB06241 DB00057 DB00112 DB12755 DB09342 DB05793 DB06013 DB06049 DB06168 DB11618 DB16659 DB13683 DB14996 DB16222 DB06043 DB11945 DB08879 DB00076 DB06366 DB09037 DB11478 DB05550 DB12169 DB06612 DB15397 DB05595 DB13956 DB06318 DB11569 DB13953 DB14784 DB09317 DB14824 DB16376 DB15453 DB11580 DB01002 DB00445 DB12142 DB14580 DB05555 DB16195 DB12189 DB00110 DB09077 DB15428 DB00075 DB14724 DB05101 DB00078 DB05136 DB04956 DB06081 DB12159 DB11856 DB06101 DB00073 DB06643 DB12560 DB12797 DB05496 DB12157 DB12609 DB05916 DB05889 DB06467 DB12102 DB04958 DB12342 DB09070 DB14988 DB12090 DB15432 DB06774 DB00645 DB15363 DB00111 DB01270 DB06420 DB13418 DB14947 DB09085 DB15441 DB15383 DB14962 DB15349 DB00997 DB05941 DB11930 DB06050 DB00296 DB06162 DB00694 DB12489 DB09264 DB13328 DB12773 DB12456 DB06273 DB12413 DB00721 DB12317 DB06317 DB14809 DB12807 DB00750 DB00892 DB15334 DB00089 DB05097 DB11840 DB13375 DB16732 DB08987 DB12202 DB13045 DB00016 DB11148 DB06360 DB15595 DB00051 DB14908 DB12820 DB15941 DB15113 DB00095 DB01177 DB05578 DB15101 DB00286 DB12701 DB14778 DB12331 DB15335 DB14762 DB06186 DB15559 DB11850 DB08902 DB15409 DB15014 DB00907 DB00527 DB12296 DB13143 DB16695 DB16394 DB15225 DB12250 DB15434 DB14042 DB04573 DB00269 DB12213 DB16077 DB12240 DB06650 DB16393 DB11646 DB15252 DB00056 DB11803 DB09036 DB14707 DB12683 DB13923 DB16421 DB16151 DB09302 DB12118 DB05915 DB00655 DB14871 DB00081 DB00087 DB11657 DB12775 DB04988 DB05996 DB11767 DB13952 DB05139 DB13103 DB06304 DB11595 DB09029 DB00961 DB00807 DB05545 DB08935 DB15076 DB11972 DB06116 DB14040 DB06674 DB15900 DB09331 DB14041 DB13127 DB15719 DB04574 DB03255 DB07931 DB15044 DB06770 DB11608 DB15104 DB11862 DB05336 DB11714 DB12152 DB11776 DB15253 DB06324 DB12534 DB04964 DB15336 DB11849 DB05773 DB14597 DB15940 DB09057 DB12718 DB00074 DB11617 DB13037 DB06342 DB00255 DB05405 DB12077 DB09312 DB04575","absorption":"In patients with HER2-positive relapsed or refractory breast cancer, margetuximab administered at the recommended dose results in a steady-state geometric mean (%CV) C<sub>max<\/sub> of 466 (20%) Î¼g\/mL and an AUC<sub>0-21d<\/sub> of 4120 (21%) Î¼g\\*day\/mL.

Atopic dermatitis is characterized by epidermal hyperplasia, skin barrier dysfunction, and the aberrant activation of immune cells.

Upon ligand binding and subsequent dimerization of cytokine and hormone receptors, receptor-associated JAKs are activated and phosphorylated. This allows the binding of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs), which are transcription factors. STAT binds to the receptor, and JAK phosphorylates and activates STAT to create a STAT dimer. The STAT dimer translocates to the nucleus to upregulate the gene transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors implicated in atopic dermatitis.[A183188,A244549] Blocking the JAK-STAT pathway is advantageous, as it is an intracellular signalling pathway where many pro-inflammatory pathways converge.[A244554]\r\n\r\nEach JAK plays a role in the signalling and regulation of different cytokines and immune cells. In atopic dermatitis, JAK1 is the therapeutic target of focus as it is involved in the signalling of the Î³c family of cytokines involved in immune responses and disease pathophysiology, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15.[A244549] Abrocitinib reversibly inhibits JAK1 by blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site. Biochemical assays demonstrate that abrocitinib is selective for JAK1 over JAK2 (28-fold), JAK3 (>340-fold), and tyrosine kinase (TYK) 2 (43-fold), as well as the broader kinome.[L39769] Similarly, in cellular settings, abrocitinib preferentially inhibited cytokine-induced STAT phosphorylation by signalling pairs involving JAK1, while sparing signalling by JAK2\/JAK2, or JAK2\/TYK2 pairs.[L39774]

The genetic mutation associated with this disease leads to the formation of abnormal, sickle shaped red blood cells that aggregate and block blood vessels throughout the body, causing vaso-occlusive crises.[T734] Voxelotor binds irreversibly with the Nâ\u20AC�terminal valine of the Î±â\u20AC�chain of hemoglobin, leading to an allosteric modification of Hb20, which increases the affinity for oxygen. Oxygenated HbS does not polymerize.[A188126,A188129] By directly blocking HbS polymerization, voxelotor can successfully treat sickle cell disease by preventing the formation of abnormally shaped cells, which eventually cause lack of oxygenation and blood flow to organs.[A188123,A188138,T734]","drug-interactions":"DB01873 DB11459 DB00328 DB00682 DB08953 DB12095 DB13456 DB14649 DB09198 DB06737

However, the specific mutations, and hence the precise exon skipping, targeted by each is different.\r\n\r\nCasimersen was granted accelerated FDA approval on February 25, 2021, based on data showing an increase in dystrophin levels in skeletal muscle of patients treated with casimersen; this approval is contingent on further verification in confirmatory trials.

The disease then progresses rapidly to loss of independent ambulatory function, ventilatory insufficiency, and cardiomyopathy, with death typically occurring in the second or third decade of life.[A218171, A218176, A229988]\r\n\r\nThe human _DMD_ gene contains 79 exons spread over approximately 2.4 million nucleotides on the X chromosome.[A218171] DMD is associated with a variety of underlying mutations, including exon duplications or deletions, as well as point mutations leading to nonsense translation through direct production of an in-frame stop codon, frameshift production of an in-frame stop codon, or aberrant inclusion of an intronic pseudo-exon with the concomitant production of an in-frame stop codon.[A218171, A218176] In all cases, no functional dystrophin protein is produced. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a related condition with in-frame mutations that result in the production of a truncated but partially functional dystrophin protein.

type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in which autoantibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens cause hemolysis at low (3-4Â°C) temperatures.[A245154,L40114] This cold subtype accounts for approximately 15-25% of all AIHA and is more common in the elderly.[A245159,L40114] In approximately 90% of cases, patients develop immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies towards the I antigen on erythrocytes - these antibodies react optimally at 4Â°C and are therefore referred to as \"cold agglutinin\".[A245144] Hemolysis in patients with CAD is driven by complement activation, which initiates a cascade that ultimately leads to both intra- and extravascular hemolysis.[A245159] The most common presenting symptoms in patients with CAD are chronic anemia, acrocyanosis, and Raynaud phenomenon.[A245159]\r\n\r\nTreatment options for patients with CAD are limited. In addition to non-pharmacological strategies, such as counseling patients to keep warm and the use of red blood cell transfusions, approximately 70% of patients require pharmacological treatment.[A245159] Pharmacologic strategies have included the targeting of B-cells with agents like [rituximab], as well as targeting of the complement system with drugs like [eculizumab], an anti-C5 mAb, and [pegcetacoplan], a novel inhibitor of C3.[A245154] Notably, none of these agents are approved for use in the treatment of CAD.\r\n\r\nSutimlimab is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody targeted at complement subunit C1s, which is responsible for activating the classic complement pathway.[A245144] It received FDA approval in February 2022, under the brand name Enjamyo

An initial trigger, such as infection, causes differentiation of naive T cells into T<sub>H<\/sub>17 helper T cells that induce the release from macrophages of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-Î± and IL-1Î²), which prime neutrophils. Concurrently, the anaphylatoxin C5a is produced through activation of the alternative complement pathway, which also primes neutrophils through binding to the C5a receptor (C5aR; CD88). Primed neutrophils undergo physiological changes, including upregulating the display of ANCA antigens on their surface. Circulating ANCAs bind to displayed ANCA antigens on the surface of neutrophils; simultaneously, the Fc region of these ANCAs is recognized by FcÎ³ receptors on other neutrophils, resulting in excessive neutrophil activation. Activated neutrophils form NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps), which induce tissue damage and vasculitis.

Furthermore, neutrophils activated by C5a release reactive oxygen species, properdin, and other molecules that stimulate the complement pathway leading to the production of more C5a in a vicious cycle.[A240249, A240254]\r\n\r\nAvacopan (CCX168) is a specific C5aR receptor allosteric antagonist that inhibits C5a-mediated neutrophil activation both _in vitro_ and _in vivo_.[A240269, A240274, A240329] By inhibiting the C5a\/C5aR axis, avacopan should have minimal effects on the formation of the membrane attack complex (which includes C5b) and therefore little effect on the innate immune response in treated patients.[A240254, A240259]","drug-interactions":"DB01149 DB00537 DB08953 DB11672 DB00682 DB12095 DB00564 DB00188 DB05667 DB00398 DB00951 DB12001 DB11581 DB09280 DB06448 DB12015 DB02703 DB09570 DB06712 DB00204 DB09065 DB11952 DB00540 DB08899 DB00637 DB14019 DB00648 DB15035 DB00199 DB09071 DB00794 DB08873 DB04896 DB11986 DB09185 DB12978 DB09079 DB00270 DB01232 DB00309 DB11963 DB01263 DB01234 DB01264 DB12371 DB01223 DB12483 DB00582 DB01211 DB06772 DB08882 DB11642 DB08912 DB00277 DB00444 DB00312 DB00363 DB06287 DB01229 DB00675 DB12235 DB00503 DB09063 DB00570 DB15569 DB15762 DB00220 DB12952 DB01128 DB01590 DB08901 DB01406 DB01431 DB12147 DB09030 DB05316 DB00248 DB06626 DB06237 DB01601 DB00320 DB04855 DB01395 DB00531 DB12825 DB01072 DB00625 DB06218 DB09048 DB11828 DB01396 DB11901 DB00530 DB01242 DB01254 DB13874 DB00563 DB08865 DB15444 DB01174 DB01039 DB08877 DB00705 DB01656 DB00246 DB05109 DB01227 DB06700 DB00477 DB08896 DB09330 DB14568 DB00224 DB00604 DB02520 DB00997 DB01118 DB11703 DB12267 DB01320 DB08910 DB05294 DB11886 DB14921 DB00773 DB09231 DB00454 DB00176 DB01323 DB11753 DB12515 DB01087 DB04845 DB09074 DB01624 DB06717 DB11779 DB01008 DB11730 DB00864 DB09299 DB01418 DB00343 DB14009 DB06212 DB00622 DB00196 DB00342 DB06731 DB09289 DB00227 DB00590 DB01181 DB00361 DB06603 DB11742 DB05521 DB11652 DB11932 DB00673 DB06636 DB13345 DB09143 DB01100 DB00575 DB13179 DB09101 DB01026 DB11641 DB01110 DB04868 DB06176 DB01248 DB09054 DB08881 DB06595 DB00976 DB06119 DB00877 DB09034 DB06290 DB14960 DB09118 DB00661 DB00717 DB04832 DB08827 DB00946 DB00908 DB00502 DB05773 DB00932 DB04572 DB01183 DB06616 DB00091 DB11363 DB09227 DB00252 DB01045 DB11633 DB12141 DB00762 DB01098 DB00763 DB00207 DB00247 DB00567 DB09073 DB12887 DB01167 DB06589 DB00696 DB00872 DB00541 DB01268 DB01201 DB08870 DB05239 DB13385 DB00701 DB09046 DB15982 DB00518 DB11273 DB05154","absorption":"In AAV patients receiving 30 mg avacopan twice daily, avacopan had a C<sub>max<\/sub> of 349 Â± 169 ng\/mL and an AUC<sub>0-12hr<\/sub> of 3466 Â± 1921 ng\\*h\/mL.

Insomnia is characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and\/or sleep maintenance and impairment of daytime functioning. It chronically affects the person's daily functioning and long-term health effects, as insomnia is often associated with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and depression. Conventional treatments for insomnia include drugs targeting gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABA-A), serotonin, histamine, or melatonin receptors; however, undesirable side effects are frequently reported, such as next-morning residual sleepiness, motor incoordination, falls, memory and cognitive impairment. Novel drugs that target orexin receptors gained increasing attention after discovering the role of orexin signalling pathway in wakefulness and [almorexant], an orexin receptor antagonist that improved sleep. Daridorexant was designed via an intensive drug discovery program to improve the potency and maximize the duration of action while minimizing next-morning residual activity.[A244225] \r\n\r\nDaridorexant works on orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R to block the binding of orexins, which are wake-promoting neuropeptides and endogenous ligands to these receptors. Daridorexant reduces overactive wakefulness: in the investigational trials, daridorexant reportedly improved sleep and daytime functioning in patients with insomnia.[A244225] It was approved by the FDA on January 10, 2022, under the name QUVIVIQ.[L39660] as the second orexin receptor antagonist approved to treat insomnia following [suvorexant].[A244280] Daridorexant was approved by the European Commission on May 3, 2022 as the first dual orexin receptor antagonist approved in the market.[L41725]","enzymes":"BE0002638","type":"small molecule","cas-number":"1505484-82-1","sequences":null,"targets":"BE0005865 BE0005864","unii":"LMQ24G57E9","protein-binding":"Daridorexant is 99.7% bound to plasma proteins.[L39655]","fda-label":null,"clearance":"There is limited information on clearance.","atc-codes":null,"pdb-entries":false,"food-interactions":"Avoid alcohol.

OXA binds more preferentially to OX1R, while OX2R shows a dual affinity for OXA and OXB.[A244290] The defined role of each orexin receptor is still unclear; however, there is some evidence suggesting that OX2R regulates sleep and wake, while OX1R have some role in sleep maintenance.[A244280] Daridorexant blocks the binding of wake-promoting neuropeptides OXA and OXB to OX1R and OX2R, thereby suppressing wake drive.[L39655] Daridorexant selectively targets orexin neurons and inhibits downstream neuronal pathways that promote wakefulness; however, it does not affect neuronal pathways that

These downstream cascades promote the expression of genes involved in B cell proliferation and survival.[A187952] The BCR signalling pathway also induces the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL and regulates the integrin Î±4Î²1 (VLA-4)-mediated adhesion of B cells to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and fibronectin via BTK. Apart from the direct downstream signal transduction pathway of B cells, BTK is also involved in chemokine receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR) and Fc receptor signalling pathways.[A187985] \r\n\r\nZanubrutinib inhibits BTK by forming a covalent bond with cysteine 481 residue in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)â\u20AC\u201Cbinding pocket of BTK, which is the enzyme's active site. This binding specificity is commonly seen with other BTK inhibitors. Due to this binding profile, zanubrutinib may also bind with varying affinities to related and unrelated ATP-binding kinases that possess a cysteine residue at this position.[A187958] By blocking the BCR signalling pathway, zanubrutinib inhibits the proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion of malignant B cells, ultimately leading to reduced tumour size.[L10163] Zanubrutinib was also shown to downregulate programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1) expression and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) on CD4+ T cells.[A187949]","drug-interactions":"DB01873 DB11459 DB00682 DB14652 DB08953 DB12095 DB13456 DB14649 DB13259 DB00916 DB15673 DB06712 DB00637 DB12130 DB12020 DB00814 DB09185 DB00338 DB14633 DB00845 DB05232 DB11921 DB00957 DB01086 DB01229 DB12235 DB00321 DB00503 DB06148 DB12952 DB00220 DB13843 DB09030 DB05316 DB13867 DB01075 DB00531 DB08970 DB12825 DB00769 DB01127 DB11901 DB08865 DB00741 DB01039 DB11823 DB00246 DB13208 DB01381 DB09383 DB05814 DB00714 DB00778 DB00481 DB00301 DB00238 DB02520 DB05676 DB06739 DB00959 DB08820 DB11703 DB00281 DB01320 DB00136 DB00834 DB13943 DB01323 DB01319 DB13578 DB14659 DB01259 DB09074 DB01624 DB06717 DB04938 DB13409 DB01062 DB09299 DB13954 DB01466 DB14009 DB13879 DB12332 DB00370 DB14635 DB00012 DB00835 DB11932 DB11742 DB13287 DB11951 DB01281 DB00758 DB05521 DB11502 DB01100 DB06233 DB09101 DB00607 DB04868 DB08881 DB00549 DB06595 DB06119 DB06290 DB14960 DB01184 DB00908 DB06616 DB00091 DB09227 DB11633 DB08894 DB11613 DB14540 DB00180 DB00949 DB06589 DB00872 DB01201 DB08870 DB00819 DB09046 DB01015 DB08906 DB01152 DB16390 DB05928 DB09238 DB06738 DB00668 DB09107 DB00951 DB04839 DB06448 DB12015 DB02703 DB00586 DB00715 DB11952 DB01156 DB14019 DB00648 DB08873 DB09309 DB00241 DB00468 DB01333 DB00270 DB12010 DB00641 DB13955 DB00307 DB01093 DB00753 DB01234 DB02709 DB00582 DB15463 DB00312 DB00363 DB00316 DB04871 DB01435 DB09063 DB04884 DB00418 DB00313 DB06201 DB00297 DB00193 DB08905 DB06237 DB11757 DB00568 DB13874 DB09068 DB15444 DB00705 DB06663 DB00624 DB00532 DB00224 DB11400 DB00394 DB00604 DB00065 DB05541 DB12532 DB01118 DB12089 DB08904 DB00776 DB03010 DB00559 DB11886 DB12917 DB00454 DB00176 DB01104 DB01161 DB11383 DB12391 DB01095 DB11730 DB00921 DB09345 DB09009 DB00343 DB00622 DB00196 DB11560 DB06372 DB09342 DB00590 DB01181 DB11652 DB00812 DB13345 DB00379 DB06414 DB01384 DB00591 DB00818 DB11470 DB01275 DB01026 DB09095 DB06168 DB01248 DB00615 DB00849 DB00717 DB01037 DB08909 DB00661 DB09118 DB13683 DB11697 DB00502 DB00932 DB00252 DB01045 DB09001 DB01047 DB00763 DB14761 DB00353 DB01016 DB13956 DB01011 DB06318 DB01167 DB13953 DB00619 DB01071 DB01002 DB05239 DB13385 DB00603 DB14545 DB00518 DB00956 DB00745 DB11672 DB15566 DB05667 DB00564 DB00398 DB00330 DB01173 DB11581 DB08864 DB09065 DB08899 DB07348 DB13003 DB13944 DB06469 DB04896 DB11752 DB04905 DB09241 DB14724 DB01587 DB01232 DB13950 DB01263 DB00636 DB00755 DB04956 DB01609 DB09235 DB06791 DB08995 DB01211 DB14681 DB00675 DB01029 DB01369 DB00954 DB15569 DB01431 DB14737 DB00215 DB01601 DB01072 DB06774 DB06218 DB00625 DB09048 DB00645 DB00751 DB01154 DB01254 DB01483 DB00357 DB00485 DB01380 DB01656 DB01236 DB06700 DB00477 DB00208 DB09330 DB06413 DB01685 DB09085 DB12597 DB11487 DB00349 DB00997 DB11805 DB09167 DB00296 DB01151 DB14921 DB11753 DB01138 DB00443 DB05903 DB11405 DB04975 DB06442 DB11779 DB00694 DB00865 DB00864 DB00446 DB13328 DB06273 DB00721 DB14975 DB14631 DB00750 DB00892 DB00627 DB01013 DB00104 DB06636 DB08971 DB01043 DB01589 DB13179 DB01110 DB08987 DB06176 DB09054 DB14512 DB00976 DB13132 DB09308 DB14575 DB00860 DB04832 DB00016 DB11148 DB00273 DB04070 DB00051 DB04911 DB11442 DB00163 DB01098 DB00207 DB00567 DB00197 DB09073 DB00588 DB00696 DB00333 DB00026 DB00470 DB00458 DB01221 DB11586 DB12265 DB05154 DB01149 DB00537 DB06729 DB09280 DB15011 DB13338 DB00759 DB09071 DB00199 DB00907 DB06697 DB00794 DB00527 DB09079 DB01222 DB09119 DB14539 DB01351 DB00857 DB15434 DB11963 DB01264 DB12371 DB14646 DB11642 DB08912 DB08882 DB00444 DB00574 DB01352 DB08816 DB00570 DB15762 DB01128 DB00041 DB01406 DB06470 DB01028 DB09036 DB06710 DB04794 DB00320 DB04855 DB09099 DB01395 DB03575 DB00530 DB01007 DB01174 DB00678 DB06268 DB14568 DB04920 DB04894 DB01285 DB11767 DB05482 DB13952 DB01544 DB12070 DB01032 DB00439 DB13941 DB09231 DB12515 DB09029 DB01764 DB00961 DB00764 DB01087 DB00807 DB12245 DB00647 DB06674 DB06370 DB01069 DB00501 DB06209 DB06419 DB08883 DB00342 DB06458 DB00400 DB06731 DB06174 DB12266 DB00227 DB09061 DB14240 DB00620 DB16236 DB00673 DB03255 DB00683 DB06770 DB00243 DB01645 DB14669 DB06587 DB01159 DB09034 DB09499 DB08827 DB01628 DB00184 DB04572 DB01183 DB12141 DB00762 DB01559 DB11837 DB00247 DB06342 DB00255 DB01074 DB15822 DB12887 DB00515 DB00472 DB00898 DB00533 DB00701 DB00005 DB15982 DB01388 DB11273","absorption":"Following oral administration of zanubrutinib 160 mg twice daily and 320 mg once daily, the mean (%CV) zanubrutinib steady-state concentrations were 2,295 (37%) ngÂ·h\/mL and 2,180 (41%) ngÂ·h\/mL, respectively.

This process is mediated through both direct apoptosis and immune-mediated effector mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).[L15292]","drug-interactions":"DB05209 DB14905 DB06474 DB09381 DB06647 DB11959 DB09052 DB13259 DB12034 DB11857 DB14039 DB12023 DB06305 DB15898 DB14877 DB00814 DB11604 DB12344 DB13886 DB05232 DB14811 DB11884 DB11685 DB11746 DB15118 DB01086 DB14997 DB12815 DB12235 DB06602 DB12053 DB14012 DB09035 DB14891 DB13017 DB01075 DB00108 DB06599 DB06310 DB14864 DB09105 DB12520 DB12396 DB05797 DB05656 DB06557 DB12274 DB11680 DB13140 DB06607 DB15443 DB00281 DB14897 DB13578 DB00028 DB12104 DB15001 DB12261 DB12849 DB13954 DB12826 DB12844 DB04962 DB11866 DB12205 DB12498 DB11715 DB00012 DB00098 DB11502 DB11621 DB16385 DB00113 DB12246 DB15627 DB00002 DB04949 DB13535 DB01257 DB12335 DB00890 DB04901 DB11976 DB12119 DB09045 DB14952 DB00054 DB05111 DB08894 DB15626 DB16225 DB12698 DB13073 DB08870 DB11731 DB14776 DB11771 DB05304 DB12893 DB15090 DB16755 DB09107 DB05437 DB14919 DB15135 DB05459 DB14211 DB12363 DB15865 DB12943 DB12584 DB15899 DB09369 DB00977 DB12891 DB15415 DB05276 DB11914 DB16170 DB00072 DB11988 DB06371 DB11674 DB15045 DB01269 DB06550 DB16355 DB06322 DB13976 DB15089 DB14967 DB13979 DB11834 DB05679 DB05006 DB00297 DB09318 DB14843 DB12589 DB06606 DB11756 DB15160 DB14907 DB12734 DB15022 DB15277 DB15172 DB11597 DB00783 DB12530 DB16265 DB00065 DB15718 DB05892 DB13386 DB12532 DB12089 DB09303 DB08904 DB12487 DB14959 DB12917 DB12845 DB06192 DB01161 DB00043 DB15628 DB12976 DB09559 DB01357 DB09033 DB09345 DB11826 DB14004 DB09009 DB06241 DB00057 DB00112 DB09342 DB05793 DB06049 DB06168 DB16659 DB13683 DB14996 DB16222 DB06043 DB11945 DB08879 DB00076 DB06366 DB09037 DB11478 DB05550 DB12169 DB06612 DB15397 DB05595 DB13956 DB06318 DB11569 DB13953 DB14784 DB09317 DB14824 DB16376 DB15453 DB11580 DB01002 DB12142 DB14580 DB05555 DB16195 DB12189 DB00110 DB09077 DB15428 DB00075 DB14724 DB05101 DB00078 DB05136 DB04956 DB06081 DB12159 DB11856 DB06101 DB00073 DB06643 DB12560 DB12797 DB05496 DB12157 DB12609 DB05916 DB05889 DB06467 DB12102 DB04958 DB12342 DB09070 DB14988 DB12090 DB15432 DB06774 DB00645 DB15363 DB00111 DB01270 DB13418 DB14947 DB09085 DB15441 DB15383 DB14962 DB15349 DB05941 DB11930 DB06050 DB00296 DB06162 DB12489 DB09264 DB13328 DB12773 DB12456 DB06273 DB12413 DB00721 DB12317 DB06317 DB14809 DB12807 DB00750 DB00892 DB15334 DB00089 DB05097 DB11840 DB13375 DB16732 DB08987 DB12202 DB13045 DB00016 DB11148 DB06360 DB15595 DB00051 DB14908 DB12820 DB15941 DB15113 DB00095 DB05578 DB15101 DB00286 DB12701 DB14778 DB12331 DB15335 DB14762 DB06186 DB15559 DB11850 DB08902 DB15409 DB15014 DB00907 DB00527 DB12296 DB13143 DB16695 DB16394 DB15225 DB12250 DB15434 DB14042 DB04573 DB00269 DB12213 DB16077 DB12240 DB06650 DB16393 DB11646 DB15252 DB00056 DB11803 DB09036 DB14707 DB12683 DB13923 DB16421 DB16151 DB09302 DB12118 DB05915 DB00655 DB14871 DB00081 DB00087 DB11657 DB12775 DB04988 DB05996 DB11767 DB13952 DB05139 DB06304 DB11595 DB09029 DB15258 DB00961 DB00807 DB05545 DB08935 DB15076 DB11972 DB06116 DB14040 DB06674 DB15900 DB09331 DB14041 DB13127 DB15719 DB04574 DB03255 DB07931 DB06770 DB11608 DB15104 DB11862 DB05336 DB11714 DB12152 DB11776 DB15253 DB06324 DB12534 DB04964 DB15336 DB11849 DB05773 DB14597 DB15940 DB09057 DB12718 DB00074 DB13037 DB06342 DB00255 DB05405 DB12077 DB09312 DB04575","absorption":"Following intravenous administration of tafasitamab 12 mg\/kg on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in cycle(s) 1-3 (with an additional dose on Day 4 of cycle 1), mean trough concentrations were 179 (Â± 53) Î¼g\/mL.

The overexpression of ALAS1, in combination with downstream enzyme deficiencies, leads to the overproduction and accumulation of toxic heme intermediates which are ultimately responsible for the neurovisceral symptoms characteristic of acute hepatic porphyrias.[L10202,A187988]\r\n\r\nGivosiran is a double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed at ALAS1 mRNA in hepatocytes.[L10202] It is covalently bound to a ligand containing three N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues that facilitate uptake into hepatocytes via asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASPGRs), which are highly expressed on the cell surface of hepatocytes and are selective for glycoproteins containing GalNAc residues.[F4727] Following endocytosis into hepatocytes, the antisense strand of givosiran is loaded into an enzyme complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which uses the antisense strand to seek out and selectively cleave the complementary mRNA sequence (in this case found between nucleotide 918 and 937 of the ALAS1 mRNA).[F4727] Cleavage of the ALAS1 mRNA results in its degradation, preventing the synthesis of the ALAS1 enzyme and ultimately leading to reduced circulating levels of neurotoxic heme intermediates.","drug-interactions":"DB13821 DB01345 DB00328 DB00682 DB00928 DB00887 DB00742 DB06196 DB00656 DB06255 DB06737 DB00382 DB09570 DB00540 DB00737 DB09205 DB01142

Generally, asthma can be divided into \"type 2\" (T2, including allergic and eosinophilic presentations) and T2-low (including neutrophilic and paucigranulocytic presentations) endotypes, each driven by distinct underlying pathways.[A243764, A243769] Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an innate pleiotropic IL-2-family cytokine distantly related to IL-7; two forms of TSLP exist, with a short isoform (sfTSLP, 60 amino acids long) and a long isoform (lfTSLP, 159 amino acids long). The short isoform appears to be constitutively expressed, especially by lung and gut epithelial cells, while lfTSLP is upregulated in response to proinflammatory stimuli. While the role of sfTSLP is still unclear, lfTSLP has emerged as an upstream alarmin central to the pathophysiology of inflammatory disorders including asthma, atopic rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and atopic dermatitis.[A243764, A243769, A243774]\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions, lfTSLP interacts with its cognate receptor TSLPR, and IL-7RÎ± in a ternary complex with three contact sites labelled site I (TSLP:TSLPR), site II (TSLP:IL-7RÎ±), and site III (TSLPR:IL-7RÎ±). The assembly of the ternary complex is stepwise, as TSLP does not interact appreciably with IL-7RÎ± until after it has bound TSLPR. Complementary electrostatic surfaces on TSLP and TSLPR mediate initial high affinity formation of a TSLP:TSLPR complex (_K_<sub>D<\/sub> of 32 nM and _k_<sub>a<\/sub> of 1.7 x 10<sup>5<\/sup> M<sup>-1<\/sup>s<sup>-1<\/sup>). This initial binding induces a restructuring of the Ï\u20AC-helical turn in the TSLP Î±A helix and structuring of the AB loop to facilitate binding of TSLP to a hydrophobic patch on IL-7RÎ± to form the ternary complex (_K_<sub>D<\/sub> of 29 nM and _k_<sub>a<\/sub> of 1.23 x 10<sup>5<\/sup> M<sup>-1<\/sup>s<sup>-1<\/sup>). The complete ternary complex is stabilized by additional interactions between TSLPR and IL-7RÎ± at site III near the transmembrane domain of each receptor.[A243779]\r\n\r\nFormation of the ternary complex activates JAK1\/2, which, through downstream pathways involving STAT3\/5, NF-ÎºB, PI3K, and MAPK, induces the expression of Th2 cytokines including IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13.[A243764] TSLP can induce Th2 cytokine production by stimulating dendritic cells and ILC2 cells (primarily in T2 asthma). Furthermore, TSLP has been implicated in steroid resistance of ILC2 cells. In neutrophilic asthma, TSLP induces dendritic cells to drive the development of Th17 cells, which secrete IL-17A to recruit neutrophils and drive inflammation. In paucigranulocytic asthma, TSLP mediates cross-talk between mast cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. Hence, despite different underlying pathways, TSLP appears to function as a critical upstream driver across asthma endotypes.[A243764, A243769, A243774]\r\n\r\nTezepelumab is a human monoclonal IgG2Î» antibody that binds to TSLP with a dissociation constant of 15.8 pM.[A243779, L39504] Specifically, the variable heavy chain domain (V<sub>H<\/sub>) complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of tezepelumab bind TSLP at the _AB_-loop region and C-terminal region of the Î±D helix, obstructing the TSLPR binding region while leaving the IL-7RÎ± binding region unobstructed. As TSLP is incapable of binding IL-7RÎ± prior to its inclusion in the TSLP:TSLPR dimer, tezepelumab effectively blocks the assembly of the ternary complex and resulting downstream signalling.[A243779] Furthermore, unlike existing therapies that act on specific downstream effector molecules, targeting TSLP ensures effective upstream blockade and is expected to be efficacious against multiple asthma endotypes.[A243764, A243769, A243774]","drug-interactions":"DB05209 DB14905 DB06474 DB09381 DB06647 DB11959 DB09052 DB12034 DB11857 DB14039 DB12023 DB06305 DB15898 DB14877 DB11604 DB12344 DB13886 DB14811 DB11884 DB11685 DB11746 DB15118 DB14997 DB12815 DB12235 DB06602 DB12053 DB14012 DB09035 DB14891 DB13017 DB00108 DB06599 DB06310 DB14864 DB09105 DB12520 DB12396 DB05797 DB05656 DB06557 DB12274 DB11680 DB13140 DB06607 DB15443 DB14897 DB00028 DB12104 DB15001 DB12261 DB12849 DB13954 DB12826 DB12844 DB04962 DB11866 DB12205 DB12498 DB11715 DB00098 DB11621 DB16385 DB00113 DB12246 DB15627 DB00002 DB04949 DB13535 DB01257 DB12335 DB00890 DB04901 DB11976 DB12119 DB09045 DB14952 DB00054 DB05111 DB15626 DB16225 DB12698 DB13073 DB08870 DB11731 DB14776 DB11771 DB05304 DB12893 DB16755 DB05437 DB14919 DB15135 DB05459 DB14211 DB12363 DB15865 DB12943 DB12584 DB15899 DB09369 DB00977 DB12891 DB15415 DB05276 DB11914 DB16170 DB00072 DB11988 DB06371 DB11674 DB15045 DB01269 DB06550 DB16355 DB06322 DB13976 DB15089 DB14967 DB13979 DB11834 DB05679 DB05006 DB09318 DB14843 DB12589 DB06606 DB11756 DB15160 DB14907 DB12734 DB15022 DB15277 DB15172 DB11597 DB00783 DB12530 DB16265 DB00065 DB15718 DB05892 DB13386 DB12089 DB09303 DB08904 DB12487 DB14959 DB12917 DB12845 DB06192 DB00043 DB15628 DB12976 DB09559 DB01357 DB09033 DB11826 DB14004 DB06241 DB00057 DB00112 DB05793 DB06049 DB06168 DB16659 DB14996 DB16222 DB06043 DB11945 DB08879 DB00076 DB06366 DB09037 DB11478 DB05550 DB12169 DB06612 DB15397 DB05595 DB13956 DB06318 DB11569 DB13953 DB14784 DB09317 DB14824 DB16376 DB15453 DB11580 DB12142 DB14580 DB05555 DB16195 DB12189 DB00110 DB09077 DB15428 DB00075 DB14724 DB05101 DB00078 DB05136 DB04956 DB06081 DB12159 DB11856 DB06101 DB00073 DB06643 DB12560 DB12797 DB05496 DB12157 DB12609 DB05916 DB05889 DB06467 DB12102 DB04958 DB12342 DB09070 DB14988 DB12090 DB15432 DB15363 DB00111 DB01270 DB13418 DB14947 DB15441 DB15383 DB14962 DB15349 DB05941 DB11930 DB06050 DB06162 DB12489 DB09264 DB12773 DB12456 DB06273 DB12413 DB12317 DB06317 DB14809 DB12807 DB15334 DB00089 DB05097 DB11840 DB13375 DB16732 DB12202 DB13045 DB06360 DB15595 DB00051 DB14908 DB12820 DB15941 DB15113 DB00095 DB05578 DB15101 DB00286 DB12701 DB14778 DB12331 DB15335 DB14762 DB06186 DB15559 DB11850 DB08902 DB15409 DB15014 DB12296 DB13143 DB16695 DB16394 DB15225 DB12250 DB15434 DB14042 DB04573 DB00269 DB12213 DB16077 DB12240 DB06650 DB16393 DB11646 DB15252 DB00056 DB11803 DB09036 DB14707 DB12683 DB13923 DB16421 DB16151 DB09302 DB12118 DB05915 DB00655 DB14871 DB00081 DB00087 DB11657 DB12775 DB04988 DB05996 DB11767 DB13952 DB05139 DB06304 DB11595 DB09029 DB15258 DB05545 DB08935 DB15076 DB11972 DB06116 DB14040 DB06674 DB15900 DB09331 DB14041 DB13127 DB15719 DB04574 DB07931 DB15044 DB11608 DB15104 DB11862 DB05336 DB11714 DB12152 DB11776 DB15253 DB06324 DB12534 DB04964 DB15336 DB11849 DB05773 DB14597 DB15940 DB09057 DB12718 DB00074 DB13037 DB06342 DB00255 DB05405 DB12077 DB09312 DB04575","absorption":"When administered subcutaneously, tezepelumab reaches C<sub>max<\/sub> in approximately 3-10 days with an estimated absolute bioavailability of 77%, regardless of injection site choice.[L39504]\r\n\r\nTezepelumab displays dose-proportional pharmacokinetics over a range of 2.1-420 mg (0.01-2 times the recommended dose) following a single subcutaneous dose.

JAKs are tyrosine kinases that cause phosphorylation of several proteins, including cytokine receptors and JAKs themselves. Phosphorylation of JAKs promotes the phosphorylation and activation of the signalling molecules called STATs, leading to their nuclear translocation, binding to DNA promoters, and target gene transcription. JAK1-mediated signalling pathways ultimately promote pro-inflammatory events, such as increased proliferation and survival of immune cells, T cell differentiation, and macrophage activation.[A189168] Upadacitinib is a selective JAK1 inhibitor that has a negligible effect on JAK3, leading to an improved drug safety profile.[A189165] Upadacitinib blocks the cellular processes that contribute to the inflammatory conditions in rheumatoid arthritis. In human leukocytes cellular assays, upadacitinib inhibited JAK1\/3-induced phosphorylation of STAT3\/5 mediated by IL-6\/7.[L10896]","drug-interactions":"DB08880 DB00328 DB08953 DB00928 DB15274 DB12095 DB09052 DB15857 DB06712 DB00092 DB00970 DB04951 DB00034 DB09185 DB00642 DB13068 DB00495 DB11921 DB00105 DB00305 DB06772 DB16650 DB01229 DB00503 DB15646 DB12386 DB00220 DB01590 DB13843 DB13867 DB16611 DB00531 DB00108 DB08970 DB12814 DB00631 DB00888 DB01127 DB00853 DB11901 DB08865 DB11044 DB14685 DB10804 DB00246 DB13208 DB15119 DB09082 DB09383 DB00851 DB02520 DB05676 DB10584 DB00959 DB11003 DB01320 DB00773 DB01323 DB09074 DB00008 DB00120 DB00547 DB00428 DB06813 DB10990 DB01033 DB00987 DB00324 DB00276 DB11932 DB10061 DB01204 DB05521 DB00098 DB01281 DB09101 DB05942 DB04868 DB06595 DB00552 DB00877 DB06119 DB06290 DB14960 DB01257 DB11976 DB06616 DB00033 DB01005 DB00091 DB14711 DB09227 DB11633 DB15626 DB14540 DB00180 DB06589 DB00872 DB01201 DB08870 DB10276 DB09046 DB01015 DB08906 DB01410 DB00022 DB13014 DB14919 DB00951 DB05459 DB06448 DB02703 DB00526 DB10283 DB14019 DB00648 DB00601 DB08873 DB17088 DB00270 DB00993 DB00072 DB11988 DB14619 DB00307 DB01234 DB03451 DB00582 DB00635 DB11616 DB14445 DB00312 DB14066 DB10317 DB00363 DB16736 DB11834 DB01206 DB10062 DB09378 DB15656 DB14022 DB06237 DB09122 DB00069 DB12025 DB09053 DB00705 DB05109 DB00432 DB12530 DB01097 DB00224 DB00394 DB00065 DB01816 DB01118 DB08904 DB08059 DB08910 DB12917 DB00176 DB05015 DB11708 DB00550 DB15628 DB01008 DB01041 DB11730 DB09033 DB01108 DB00343 DB00622 DB00196 DB11603 DB06372 DB01280 DB11652 DB01181 DB06603 DB10600 DB10769 DB01384 DB00591 DB10794 DB01026 DB09095 DB06168 DB01248 DB01099 DB09118 DB00661 DB12996 DB00502 DB00932 DB11050 DB08908 DB08879 DB13924 DB00252 DB01045 DB01047 DB00763 DB06662 DB15982 DB06612 DB11569 DB01167 DB00619 DB01268 DB11580 DB00445 DB14545 DB03523 DB11672 DB00290 DB00322 DB02546 DB00188 DB00564 DB05667 DB00398 DB11581 DB09065 DB09077 DB08899 DB13003 DB04896 DB00075 DB14724 DB10343 DB12947 DB00078 DB16648 DB06584 DB01232 DB01263 DB00755 DB04956 DB14443 DB01211 DB00073 DB06643 DB14449 DB14394 DB06287 DB04630 DB01611 DB14783 DB00441 DB10989 DB15569 DB11040 DB00480 DB01601 DB00242 DB14384 DB14620 DB01072 DB00625 DB09048 DB00291 DB06688 DB08895 DB01254 DB00111 DB00068 DB01380 DB15810 DB01169 DB01656 DB06700 DB12991 DB00859 DB11487 DB00997 DB15654 DB14921 DB12612 DB11753 DB00443 DB04845 DB11817 DB11041 DB14385 DB11779 DB05144 DB00694 DB05472 DB00864 DB00446 DB01024 DB06273 DB05325 DB15483 DB00688 DB01196 DB06681 DB00544 DB01013 DB06636 DB11693 DB11466 DB08971 DB12692 DB13179 DB04914 DB01110 DB12568 DB09054 DB14512 DB11038 DB00976 DB01262 DB00860 DB04832 DB15595 DB00051 DB10318 DB10803 DB09073 DB00588 DB00696 DB00095 DB01177 DB14845 DB00026 DB11529 DB00488 DB00958 DB02806 DB01149 DB00537 DB14762 DB09091 DB09280 DB10991 DB10805 DB08868 DB08871 DB00199 DB00794 DB00380 DB00337 DB12902 DB05440 DB16694 DB01222 DB13856 DB14539 DB15434 DB00309 DB01264 DB12371 DB11642 DB08882 DB08912 DB00444 DB06650 DB01073 DB01423 DB00570 DB00056 DB14409 DB15762 DB05259 DB00041 DB08901 DB01406 DB11803 DB09036 DB08889 DB01030 DB04855 DB12617 DB00563 DB01174 DB08877 DB12768 DB00081 DB05374 DB00018 DB00352 DB13491 DB00087 DB14568 DB06400 DB00011 DB14513 DB01285 DB11767 DB09231 DB09029 DB00764 DB01087 DB00795 DB05260 DB08935 DB16703 DB13241 DB00059 DB15461 DB06674 DB00293 DB13223 DB00342 DB06731 DB10583 DB05258 DB00227 DB00361 DB00620 DB00673 DB06769 DB11627 DB11776 DB12016 DB15253 DB10316 DB05773 DB01101 DB04572 DB01183 DB14219 DB09057 DB00762 DB06343 DB00074 DB01168 DB00515 DB00262 DB00541 DB01042 DB09312 DB00687 DB00701 DB00005 DB10315","absorption":"Upadacitinib displays a dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile over the therapeutic dose range.

Once FGF binds to the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the receptor, FGFRs dimerize and autophosphorylate the tyrosine residue in the intracellular tyrosine-kinase domain, leading to the activation of the tyrosine kinase.[A193719] Downstream cascades involve phosphorylation of multiple intracellular signalling proteins, such as phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT and RAS\/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phospholipase CÎ³, which activates the protein kinase C pathway.[A193716,A193719] FGFR-mediated pathway ultimately promotes cell growth, differentiation, survival, angiogenesis, and organogenesis, depending on cell type. Expressed in different isoforms in various tissues and cell lines, FGFRs are not constitutively active in normal cells.[A193719] However, FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3 alterations in certain tumours can lead to constitutive FGFR activation and aberrant FGFR signalling, supporting the proliferation and survival of malignant cells.[L13050]\r\n\r\nPemigatinib inhibits FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3, blocking their signalling pathways and decreasing cell viability in cancer cell lines with activating FGFR amplification and fusions that resulted in constitutive activation of FGFR signalling.[L13050] Genetic alterations in FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 (such as amplification, missense, or fusion mutations in the coding region) leading to constitutive activation of FGFR signalling pathways are observed in various tumours.[A193719,A198984] However, alterations in FGFR genes are demonstrated in selected patients and do not always imply oncogene development. Therefore, it is imperative that fusion or rearrangement of FGFRs are demonstrated through tests prior to initiation of drug therapy.[A193716]","drug-interactions":"DB01149 DB00537 DB08953 DB11672 DB12095 DB14649 DB00564 DB09107 DB05667 DB00951 DB13259 DB11581 DB09280 DB06448 DB02703 DB06712 DB09065 DB08899 DB14019 DB00648 DB00199 DB00907 DB00794 DB08873 DB04896 DB00814 DB00527 DB09185 DB00270 DB05232 DB00307 DB01232 DB01263 DB01234 DB01264 DB00582 DB01211 DB01086 DB11642 DB08882 DB08912 DB00312 DB00363 DB00503 DB15569 DB15762 DB00220 DB00297 DB01406 DB06237 DB01601 DB04855 DB01075 DB01072 DB06774 DB00625 DB00645 DB09048 DB01127 DB11901 DB08865 DB01007 DB01174 DB00705 DB00246 DB06700 DB09085 DB14568 DB00224 DB02520 DB12532 DB01118 DB00281 DB01320 DB00296 DB00559 DB14921 DB09231 DB00176 DB01323 DB11753 DB13578 DB01161 DB00961 DB01087 DB00807 DB06442 DB11779 DB11730 DB09345 DB13328 DB09009 DB00343 DB00721 DB00622 DB00196 DB00342 DB00750 DB00892 DB06731 DB00012 DB00227 DB09342 DB11652 DB14240 DB11932 DB05521 DB00673 DB11502 DB03255 DB06636 DB06414 DB06770 DB13179 DB09101 DB01026 DB01110 DB00607 DB04868 DB08987 DB06595 DB00976 DB06119 DB06290 DB14960 DB09118 DB00661 DB13683 DB04832 DB00016 DB11148 DB00502 DB00932 DB01183 DB00091 DB09227 DB00252 DB01045 DB11633 DB08933 DB00763 DB08894 DB01167 DB00696 DB00872 DB01201 DB01002 DB00701 DB09046 DB15982 DB00745","absorption":"Following administration of a single oral dose of 13.5 mg pemigatinib, the median Tmax was 1.13 (0.50-6.00) hours.

Like other interferon alfa products, ropeginterferon alfa-2b may cause various toxicities, including endocrine, cardiovascular, pulmonary, ophthalmologic, dental\/periodontal, renal, and dermatological toxicity. In addition, interferon alfa has been associated with hepatotoxicity, including increases in serum ALT, AST, GGT, and bilirubin; ropeginterferon alfa-2b is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe (Child-Pugh B or C) hepatic impairment. Pancreatitis and colitis, including fatal ulcerative\/hemorrhagic\/ischemic colitis, have occurred in patients treated with interferon alfa. Significant toxicity of any kind may require treatment discontinuation. Interferon alfa treatment has decreased peripheral blood counts, including thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, and altered lipid levels, including hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and dyslipidemia. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur; ropeginterferon alfa-2b is contraindicated in hypersensitive patients and those with known hypersensitivity to other interferons. Life-threatening or fatal neuropsychiatric reactions may occur, including in patients without prior history; ropeginterferon alfa-2b is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe psychiatric disorders.

The main driver mutation, _JAK2_ V617F, is present in >95% of PV patients and results in constitutive JAK\/STAT signalling; other exon 12 mutations in _JAK2_ may also result in PV. PV results in clonal hematopoietic stem cells, such that they form endogenous erythroid colonies (EECs) _in vitro_.[A242000]\r\n\r\nInterferon alfa-2b has been used for decades in PV despite the lack of formal approval.[A242005] Although the mechanism of action is unclear, interferon alfa-2b is known to bind the interferon-alpha\/beta receptor (IFNAR) and activate downstream JAK\/STAT signalling.[A242005, L39170] The overall result is a series of anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic, pro-apoptotic, and immunomodulatory effects, including augmenting T-cell, macrophage, and natural

They have been implicated in the pathophysiology of type II diabetes mellitus as GLP-1R signalling is involved in glucose control by enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, delaying gastric transit, decreasing plasma glucagon levels, and reducing body weight by activating anorexigenic pathways in the brain.[A246260] Both glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 are peptide hormones involved in glucose homeostasis: they promote glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta-cells.[A246265] However, GIP is the main incretin hormone that exerts insulinotropic effects in response to food intake.[A246260,A246265]\r\n\r\nThe exact mechanism of action of tirzepatide has not been fully elucidated; however, dual agonism at GIP and GLP-1R may contribute to the glycemic and weight control effects of the drug.[A246265] Studies demonstrated that co-administration of GIP and a GLP-1R agonist more significantly increased insulin response and suppressed glucagon secretion compared to separate administration of either hormone alone.[A246270] Tirzepatide binds to GIP and GLP-1R with high affinity.[A246260,A246265] _In vitro_, tirzepatide has a comparable GIP receptor binding affinity to native GIP and five times lower GLP-1R affinity than that of native GLP-1.[A246270] Tirzepatide potently activates the GLP-1R signalling pathway to stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion through activity at the GIP receptor (GIPR) or the GLP-1R.[A246260] However, the role of GIPR agonism in the drug's mechanism of action requires further investigation, as the evidence of GIPR agonism on glycemic and weight control in preclinical and clinical studies are conflicting.[A246265]","drug-interactions":"DB00328 DB08953 DB14652 DB01208

It is characterized by neurological impairment, with manifestations like loss of consciousness and seizure. Hypoglycemia is a common side effect of antidiabetic treatments, most notably insulin and sulfonylureas. Although it tends to be more common in type 1 diabetes mellitus, occurring in about 22% to 46% of patients annually, about 7% to 25% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin experience severe hypoglycemia a year.[L39195] Even with close monitoring of blood glucose levels, it is not always possible to prevent severe hypoglycemic events in patients with diabetes, and children are particularly at risk for experiencing severe hypoglycemia.[L39200] Treatments for severe hypoglycemia have mostly been limited to intravenous dextrose and different glucagon formulations.[L39195] The approval of dasiglucagon marks the first glucagon analog approved for severe hypoglycemia treatment that does not require administration by a healthcare professional.[L39195]","enzymes":null,"type":"biotech","cas-number":"1544300-84-6","sequences":null,"targets":"BE0000527","unii":"AD4J2O47FQ","protein-binding":null,"fda-label":null,"clearance":null,"atc-codes":null,"pdb-entries":null,"food-interactions":null,"state":"solid","synthesis-reference":null,"mechanism-of-action":"Dasiglucagon is an analog of glucagon, which is a peptide hormone responsible for increasing blood glucose levels.

Adenyl cyclase increases intracellular cyclic AMP, which stimulates glycogenolysis and glucogenesis in the liver.[A19402,A242145] As glucose is primarily released from liver glycogen stores, hepatic

Tebentafusp also reduced lymphocyte counts after the first three doses, which returned to baseline before subsequent doses.[L39985] In phase III clinical trials, patients treated with tebentafusp showed a better overall survival rate compared to [pembrolizumab], [ipilimumab], or [dacarbazine].[L39995]","msds":null,"description":"Tebentafusp is a gp100 peptide-HLA-directed CD3 T cell engager.[L39995] It is a bispecific, fusion protein and first-in-class drug of immune-mobilizing monoclonal T cell receptors against cancer (ImmTACs), a recently developed cancer immunotherapy with a novel mechanism of action.

This approval marks the first bispecific T cell engager to be approved by the FDA to treat a solid tumour and being the first and only therapy for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma to be approved by the FDA.[L39995] Tebentafusp was subsequently approved for the same indication in the EU in April 2022.[L41675]","enzymes":null,"type":"biotech","cas-number":"1874157-95-5","sequences":">Subunit 2\nAQQGEEDPQALSIQEGENATMNCSYKTSINNLQWYRQNSGRGLVHLILIRSNEREKHSGR\nLRVTLDTSKKSSSLLITASRAADTASYFCATDGSTPMQFGKGTRLSVIANIQKPDPAVYQ\nLRDSKSSDKSVCLFTDFDSQTNVSQSKDSDVYITDKCVLDMRSMDFKSNSAVAWSNKSDF\nACANAFNNSIIPEDT >Subunit 1\nAIQMTQSPSSLSASVGDRVTITCRASQDIRNYLNWYQQKPGKAPKLLIYYTSRLESGVPS\nRFSGSGSGTDYTLTISSLQPEDFATYYCQQGNTLPWTFGQGTKVEIKGGGGSGGGGSGGG\nGSGGGGSGGGSEVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGYSFTGYTMNWVRQAPGKGLEWVA\nLINPYKGVSTYNQKFKDRFTISVDKSKNTAYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCARSGYYGDSDWYF\nDVWGQGTLVTVSSGGGGSDGGITQSPKYLFRKEGQNVTLSCEQNLNHDAMYWYRQDPGQG\nLRLIYYSWAQGDFQKGDIAEGYSVSREKKESFPLTVTSAQKNPTAFYLCASSWGAPYEQY\nFGPGTRLTVTEDLKNVFPPEVAVFEPSEAEISHTQKATLVCLATGFYPDHVELSWWVNGK\nEVHSGVCTDPQPLKEQPALNDSRYALSSRLRVSATFWQDPRNHFRCQVQFYGLSENDEWT\nQDRAKPVTQIVSAEAWGRAD","targets":"BE0010187","unii":"N658GY6L3E","protein-binding":"There is no information available.","fda-label":null,"clearance":"The geometric mean clearance (%CV) of tebentafusp is 16.4 L\/d (24.5%).[L39985]","atc-codes":null,"pdb-entries":null,"food-interactions":null,"state":null,"synthesis-reference":null,"mechanism-of-action":"Glycoprotein 100 (gp100) is a transmembrane glycoprotein highly expressed in melanoma cells and weakly expressed by normal melanocytes or other tissues.

The anti-CD3 effector domain of tebentafusp engages and activates CD3+ T cells to inflammatory cytokines and cytolytic proteins, which results in direct lysis of uveal melanoma tumour cells.[L39985] The anti-CD3 fragment of the drug has a lower affinity, so the T cells are not stimulated unless tebentafusp has detected gp100.[A244910] \r\n\r\nTebentafusp is only effective in HLA-A*02:01-positive patients.[L39985,A244910]","drug-interactions":"DB06770 DB12532 DB00281 DB09107 DB08987 DB00296 DB13259 DB00297 DB13578 DB13683 DB00016 DB01161 DB00961 DB00807 DB11148 DB00907 DB01075 DB00814 DB06774 DB00527 DB00645 DB09345 DB13328 DB09009 DB00721 DB05232 DB08894 DB00750 DB00892 DB00012 DB01002 DB09342 DB09085 DB01086 DB11502 DB03255","absorption":"After a single dose administration, C<sub>max<\/sub> and AUC<sub>0-7d<\/sub> increased dose-proportionally from 20 to 68 mg (0.3 to 1 times the approved recommended dose).

Ang-1 generally has a protective effect, making endothelial cells less responsive to VEGF-A, while Ang-2 increases VEGF-A-dependent NV and stimulates pericyte apoptosis and breakdown of both the blood-brain and blood-retinal barriers; Ang-2 is upregulated in retinal vascular development and retinal ischemia.[A225985, A225990, A225995, A226000]\r\n\r\nFaricimab is a bispecific antibody (bsAb) based on human IgG<sub>1<\/sub> comprising two different heavy and two different light chains capable of simultaneously binding to both VEGF-A and Ang-2 produced using the \"CrossMab\" platform.[A225995, A226005, A226010] Faricimab binds VEGF-A and Ang-2 with binding affinities (K<sub>D<\/sub>) of approximately 3 and 22 nM, respectively; importantly, faricimab does not detectably bind Ang-1.[A225995] Also, the faricimab Fc region has been modified to reduce binding to FcÎ³R and FcRn receptors. The former virtually eliminates immune-mediated functions such as antibody- and complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent phagocytosis, whereas the latter increases faricimab systemic clearance by reducing FcRn-mediated IgG recycling.[A225995] Thus, faricimab works by depleting both VEGF-A and Ang-2 to prevent retinal NV in the privileged ophthalmic environment.[A225995]","drug-interactions":null,"absorption":"Faricimab unbound plasma C<sub>max<\/sub> are estimated to be 0.23 Â± 0.07 and 0.22 Â± 0.07 Î¼g\/mL in nAMD and DME patients, respectively; these plasma levels are achieved approximately two days post-dose (T<sub>max<\/sub>).

Pain signals are then further transmitted via second-order ascending neurons to the brainstem, hypothalamus, and thalamic nuclei, and from there to several cortical regions (e.g. auditory, visual, motor cortices).[A189207] The trigeminal ganglion appears to amplify and perpetuate the migraine headache pain through the activation of perivascular fibers and the release of molecules involved in pain generation, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).[A189207]\r\n\r\nThe Î±-isoform of CGRP, expressed in primary sensory neurons, is a potent vasodilator and has been implicated in migraine pathogenesis - CGRP levels are acutely elevated during migraine attacks, return to normal following treatment with triptan medications, and intravenous infusions of CGRP have been shown to trigger migraine-like headaches in migraine patients. In addition to its vasodilatory properties, CGRP appears to be a pronociceptive factor that modulates neuronal excitability to facilitate pain responses.[A189213]\r\n\r\nUbrogepant is a potent antagonist of the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor[L10926] - it competes with CGRP for occupancy at these receptors, preventing the actions of CGRP and its ability to amplify and perpetuate migraine headache pain, ultimately terminating the headache.[A189213]","drug-interactions":"DB08880 DB08953 DB00682 DB12095 DB14649 DB12457 DB00742 DB00540 DB06712 DB00970 DB08828 DB12020 DB09185 DB00338 DB12035 DB00845 DB13878 DB06228 DB00957 DB06772 DB00503 DB01129 DB00220 DB01590 DB09030 DB04908 DB11855 DB12825 DB09076 DB11828 DB01127 DB01396 DB11901 DB00390 DB08865 DB11823 DB00246 DB01381 DB00778 DB00358 DB02520 DB08820 DB11827 DB11703 DB01320 DB00834 DB00773 DB01323 DB01259 DB09074 DB06717 DB01051 DB03467 DB13954 DB13879 DB12332 DB00370 DB11979 DB11932 DB05521 DB11951 DB09161 DB09101 DB11641 DB04881 DB00607 DB04868 DB14723 DB08881 DB11575 DB06595 DB06119 DB00877 DB01182 DB06290 DB14960 DB12364 DB08930 DB00908 DB06616 DB00091 DB05039 DB09227 DB11633 DB14973 DB00612 DB11689 DB11613 DB00949 DB06589 DB00872 DB01201 DB08870 DB09046 DB05928 DB09238 DB00203 DB00213 DB06695 DB00951 DB12001 DB04839 DB06448 DB12015 DB02703 DB00175 DB11952 DB14019 DB00648 DB04851 DB08873 DB00468 DB00270 DB12010 DB00641 DB13955 DB00307 DB06654 DB01234 DB11978 DB12026 DB00582 DB06605 DB00312 DB01094 DB00363 DB11869 DB00316 DB09183 DB09063 DB04884 DB00206 DB06201 DB12500 DB12147 DB06237 DB11757 DB00882 DB13874 DB00705 DB00783 DB06663 DB12836 DB08896 DB00224 DB00394 DB01118 DB15133 DB12267 DB08910 DB00559 DB00176 DB05015 DB09296 DB11712 DB11730 DB00921 DB11574 DB06207 DB00201 DB00343 DB00622 DB00196 DB11560 DB14068 DB00396 DB11652 DB06603 DB08893 DB06414 DB12582 DB00818 DB01026 DB00615 DB09118 DB00661 DB08909 DB16222 DB11697 DB00502 DB00932 DB11363 DB00252 DB01045 DB11853 DB08933 DB00763 DB14761 DB01016 DB14011 DB13956 DB01167 DB13953 DB00619 DB01268 DB05239 DB04847 DB06670 DB09078 DB12799 DB00745 DB11672 DB11800 DB00188 DB05667 DB00564 DB00398 DB00330 DB11581 DB01173 DB08864 DB09065 DB08899 DB07348 DB09291 DB06191 DB11362 DB04896 DB09241 DB01232 DB00295 DB08931 DB01263 DB14069 DB14989 DB01211 DB08995 DB06791 DB12941 DB06287 DB00675 DB06403 DB05889 DB00441 DB01369 DB15569 DB11732 DB00215 DB00248 DB06626 DB01601 DB01072 DB00625 DB09048 DB08907 DB01267 DB11760 DB01254 DB00836 DB01169 DB06700 DB06413 DB06210 DB01685 DB09330 DB12597 DB06234 DB00349 DB01394 DB04854 DB05294 DB14921 DB11753 DB04845 DB06442 DB11779 DB00300 DB09027 DB09239 DB00864 DB11995 DB06273 DB14631 DB00317 DB14126 DB06636 DB11693 DB13179 DB12713 DB09075 DB01110 DB06176 DB13125 DB09054 DB00976 DB04832 DB00273 DB12466 DB04911 DB04540 DB00966 DB00539 DB00408 DB09073 DB00696 DB00458 DB11586 DB01149 DB00080 DB00537 DB04216 DB11791 DB09280 DB00360 DB00199 DB00794 DB11986 DB09079 DB09119 DB02115 DB00285 DB11963 DB01264 DB00950 DB12483 DB12455 DB11642 DB08882 DB08912 DB08816 DB09039 DB00570 DB08934 DB09297 DB04348 DB15762 DB01128 DB08901 DB01406 DB08916 DB09102 DB09036 DB04794 DB06240 DB08889 DB01030 DB04855 DB09099 DB15442 DB00530 DB01007 DB01174 DB00655 DB11796 DB14568 DB04920 DB04894 DB11770 DB11767 DB13952 DB12070 DB11644 DB09231 DB13941 DB01079 DB01764 DB01087 DB00795 DB16703 DB14840 DB11967 DB00501 DB06212 DB01261 DB06419 DB00342 DB00726 DB00896 DB06731 DB09061 DB15719 DB00227 DB00448 DB14240 DB00862 DB16236 DB00673 DB00909 DB01136 DB00243 DB06769 DB01645 DB09034 DB08827 DB15149 DB05773 DB01183 DB13055 DB12141 DB11837 DB00255 DB15822 DB13007 DB12887 DB00472 DB00541 DB00898 DB00701 DB15982 DB01388","absorption":"Following oral administration, T<sub>max<\/sub> occurs between 0.7 and 1.5 h.[A189213,L10926] When administered with a high-fat meal, T<sub>max<\/sub> is delayed by approximately 2 hours and C<sub>max<\/sub> was reduced by 22% with no significant changes to the AUC.[L10926] Ubrogepant exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics throughout the entirety of its recommended dosing range.[L10926]","created":"2019-05-20","groups":"approved investigational","pathways":null,"snp-effects":null,"carriers":null,"half-life":"Ubrogepant has an elimination half-life of 5-7 hours.[L10926]","monoisotopic-mass":549.198774206,"volume-of-distribution":"The apparent central volume of distribution following oral administration is approximately 350 L.[L10926]","route-of-elimination":"The main route of elimination is fecal\/biliary, while renal excretion is comparatively minor -

case of a mosunetuzumab overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment should be instituted.[L42230] Patients experiencing an overdose are at an increased risk of severe adverse effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), febrile neutropenia, neutropenia and pneumonia.[A249320,L42230] \r\n\r\nPreclinical single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies of up to 26 weeks in duration found that transient CRS was developed mostly after the first dose of mosunetuzumab. Findings suggest that this effect is pharmacologically-mediated and reversible.[L42230] The effect of mosunetuzumab on male and female reproductive organs was evaluated in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys given an intravenous infusion dose equivalent to the one recommended in patients. Up to 26 weeks, mosunetuzumab did not have an effect on male or female reproductive organs.[L42230] Preclinical studies evaluating the effect of mosunetuzumab on developmental toxicity have not been conducted. Due to the low placental transfer of antibodies during the first trimester, mosunetuzumab is not expected to have a teratogenic effect. However, it can lead to a higher risk of opportunistic infections, which may cause fetal loss.[L42230]","snp-adverse-drug-reactions":null,"average-mass":null,"transporters":null,"pharmacodynamics":"Mosunetuzumab is an anti-CD20\/CD3 bispecific antibody that leads to B-cell depletion (CD19 B-cell counts < 0.07 x 109\/L) and hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG levels < 500 mg\/dL).[L42230] In patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) treated with mosunetuzumab, the overall response rate (ORR) was 37.4%, and the complete remission (CR) rate was 19.5%, while patients with indolent NHL treated with mosunetuzumab had an ORR of 62.7% and a CR rate of 43.3%.[A249335] The response to mosunetuzumab in a high-risk group of patients with progression of follicular lymphoma within 24 months after initiating frontline treatment (n=29) was also beneficial; the ORR was 75.9% and the CR rate was 55.2%.[A249335] \r\n\r\nPatients treated with mosunetuzumab may develop cytokine release syndrome (CRS), including life-threatening reactions. CRS mainly occurred on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1. To avoid CRS, patients should receive corticosteroids, antipyretics and antihistamines prior to mosunetuzumab therapy.[L42230] Serious infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis or septic shock have been reported in patients treated with mosunetuzumab, and caution should be exercised in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections.

Mosunetuzumab recruits T-cells and leads to their activation by promoting the formation of an immunologic synapse between a target B-cell and a cytotoxic T-cell.

The most common CFTR mutation, the _F508del_ mutation, is estimated to account for 70[A187373] to 90%[A187361,A187355] of all CFTR mutations and results in severe processing and trafficking defects of the CFTR protein.[A187358]\r\n\r\nElexacaftor is a CFTR corrector that modulates CFTR proteins to facilitate trafficking to the cell surface for incorporation into the cell membrane.[L9395] The end result is an increase in the number of mature CFTR proteins present at the cell surface and, therefore, improved ion transport and CF symptomatology. Elexacaftor is used in combination with tezacaftor, another CFTR corrector with a different mechanism of action, and ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator that improves the function of CFTR proteins on the

These effects were consistent with a coagulopathy likely caused by the formation of SQ form of human coagulation factor VIII (hFVIII-SQ) antibodies that cross-reacted with the murine factor VIII protein.[L43282] Vector integration was detected in the liver samples of non-human primates (n=12), which may lead to a higher risk of malignancies.

Long-term data (5 years follow-up) are available from 7 patients treated with valoctocogene roxaparvovec, and they all continued to show a clinically meaningful response to treatment.[L43282] The presence of pre-existing anti-adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) antibodies has a significant effect on valoctocogene roxaparvovec efficiency; therefore, it should not be used in patients with detectable anti-AAV5 antibodies.[A252812]\r\n\r\nShortly after valoctocogene roxaparvovec infusion, patients may experience infusion-related side effects. Also, due to the increased production of active factor VIII, patients may have an increased possibility of unwanted blood clot formation.

This working copy of coagulation factor VIII is then expressed in the liver, producing an active form of factor VIII that is then released into the bloodstream.

It is highly contagious: human to human transmission occurs from contact with body fluids from infected patients.[A189024] It is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms. These may be accompanied by hypotension and respiratory, kidney and liver failure, as well as internal and external bleeding.[A188994,A188997] In the _Filoviridae_ family, there are five unique Ebolavirus species that are each named after the geographical region where it was first identified. The mortality rate of the Zaire species is about 80%.[A188997]\r\n\r\nConfirmed outbreaks of Ebola virus disease have been documented since the 1970s, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where Ebola first appeared in 1976 near the Ebola River in Zaire (presently referred to as the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Sudan.[A188994] Between 2014 and 2016, Ebola outbreaks occurred in West Africa, leading to more than 11,310 total deaths during this time in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.[A188997] In 2016, this epidemic was exhausted after these countries were declared Ebola-free by 2016, and the World Health Organization (WHO) lifted the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) status on the West Africa Ebola outbreak.[L10884]\r\n\r\nThe first live, attenuated Ebola virus vaccine was developed by a team of Canadian researchers at Canadaâ\u20AC™s National Microbiology Laboratory and was later patented by the Canadian government.[L10866] In non-human primate clinical trials, the vaccine was effective in inducing an immune response against the Ebola viruses.[A189018] This vaccine was later sold to NewLink Genetics, a biotech company that held the license to the vaccine from 2010 to 2014, although the vaccine was not marketed.[L10866] In 2014, Merck Inc. signed a licensing agreement with NewLink for further development and marketing. Ervebo, the marketed Ebola virus vaccine by Merck, was first approved by the European Commission in November 2019 after the European Medicines Agency recommended it be licensed. In December 2019, Ervebo was approved by the FDA in the United States. Ervebo consists of an envelope glycoprotein of the Zaire ebolavirus (Kikwit 1995 strain) fused into a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) backbone.[L10854] By introducing the relatively inactive viral protein to the patient, the patientâ\u20AC™s immune system learns to recognize and attack the virus if he or she is exposed to it in the future.","enzymes":null,"type":"biotech","cas-number":null,"sequences":null,"targets":null,"unii":null,"protein-binding":"There is limited pharmacokinetic information on Ebola virus vaccine.","fda-label":"\/\/s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/drugbank\/fda_labels\/DB15595.pdf?1576877522","clearance":"There is limited pharmacokinetic information on Ebola virus vaccine.","atc-codes":null,"pdb-entries":null,"food-interactions":null,"state":null,"synthesis-reference":null,"mechanism-of-action":"Ebola virus disease occurs when the virus comes into contact with the host tissue and invades the tissue by breaking in the mucosa or skin.

Furthermore, the release of tissue factors and increased nitric oxide levels lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hypotension seen in the Ebola virus disease, respectively.[A188997,A189024] The incubation period after the Ebola virus infection is 1-21 days.[A189024]\r\n\r\nBy introducing the attenuated viral protein to the patient, the Ebola Zaire vaccine elicits strong cellular and antibody responses against the virus.

a derivative of the triphenylethylene drug tamoxifen, is a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Droloxifene also exhibits more rapid pharmacokinetics, reaching peak concentrations and being eliminated much more rapidly than tamoxifen. Its higher affinity to the estrogen receptor, higher anti-estrogenic to estrogenic ratio, more effective inhibition of cell growth and division in estrogen receptor-positive cell lines, and lower toxicity give it theoretical advantages over tamoxifen in the treatment of human breast cancer. Short-term toxicity was generally mild, and similar to that seen with other antiestrogens. Droloxifene appears active and tolerable. It may have a particular role in situations in which rapid pharmacokinetics, or an increased antiestrogenic to estrogenic ratio, are required. Droloxifene may also be a potentially useful agent for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis because it can prevent estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss without causing uterine hypertrophy. Droloxifene may have an effect on bone and breast tissue because it induces apoptosis. Droloxifene has an anti-implantation effect in rats, and the effect appears to be not completely due to its anti-estrogenic activity.[L34184]","enzymes":null,"type":"small

Following the initial fusion with the host cell membrane, the viral capsid is released into the host cell cytoplasm. The capsid comprises approximately 250 hexamers and exactly 12 pentamers, each composed of monomeric capsid proteins (CA). Each CA monomer has an N-terminal and C-terminal domain (NTD\/CTD) and offers an interaction surface for host cell machinery. Several important protein-protein interaction interfaces occur between CA monomers in the assembled multimers; the binding constants of these proteins are substantially lower for assembled multimers than individual capsid monomers.[A244170]\r\n\r\nTo facilitate HIV-1 genomic integration, the capsid must cross the nuclear envelope, for which it utilizes the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Two host proteins shown to be essential for capsid nuclear entry that directly bind to the capsid are cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 6 (CPSF6) and nucleoporin 153 (Nup153, an NPC protein present on the nucleoplasmic face of the complex).[A244170] Both proteins bind the same phenylalanine-glycine binding pocket between the NTD and CTD of neighbouring CA monomers in multimeric CA assemblies.[A244170, A244175, A244180, A244185]\r\n\r\nLenacapavir contains a difluorobenzyl ring that occupies the same binding pocket as CPSF6\/Nup153, overlapping with the benzyl group of F321 in CPSF6 and F1417 in Nup153 in the overlayed structures.[A244170, A244175, A244180, A244185] Crystal structures of lenacapavir bound to CA hexamers reveal that six lenacapavir molecules bind to each hexamer, establishing extensive hydrophobic interactions, two cation-Ï\u20AC interactions, and seven hydrogen bonds, contacting ~2,000 â\u201E«<sup>2<\/sup> of buried protein surface area.[A244175, A244180] Strong binding of lenacapavir, therefore competitively interrupts capsid interactions with CPSF6 and Nup153. _In vitro_ HIV-1 replication inhibition experiments in a variety of cell lines show EC<sub>50<\/sub> values of ~12-314 pM, with greater efficacy against early steps over later steps.[A244175, A244180] At very low concentrations (0.5 nM), lenacapavir inhibits viral nuclear entry, while at higher concentrations (5-50 nM), it additionally inhibits viral DNA synthesis and reverse transcription.[A244180] As CPSF6 and Nup153 are essential for nuclear entry, it is likely that lenacapavir binding inhibits these interactions and blocks capsid nuclear entry.\r\n\r\nLenacapavir may have additional effects beyond blocking interactions with host cell factors. Lenacapavir increases the rate and extent of CA assembly, dramatically extends the lifetime of assembled CA structures, even at high salt concentrations, and alters assembled capsid morphology.[A244175, A244180] The stabilizing concentration is ~1:1, closely mimicking the observed binding stoichiometry to isolated CA hexamers. Further analysis suggests that lenacapavir binding alters intra- and inter-hexamer interactions, altering the structure and stability of the resulting assemblies.[A244180]\r\n\r\nSerial passage of HIV-1 in increasing concentrations of lenacapavir resulted in the appearance of major resistance mutations Q67H and N74D, which remain sensitive to other antiretroviral drugs. Extended passage resulted in the additional mutations L56I, M66I, K70N, N74S, and T107N. All identified resistance mutations map to the lenacapavir binding site, and all but the Q67H variant show reduced replication capacity _in vitro_.[A244175] Additional studies have shown no lenacapavir resistance in variants associated with resistance to other antiretrovirals or naturally occurring polymorphisms, suggesting a very low potential for cross-resistance in combination therapy.[A244190]","drug-interactions":"DB00682 DB14649 DB00564 DB00188 DB00398 DB00656 DB12001 DB11581 DB09280 DB12015 DB10805 DB09570 DB00204 DB00540 DB08899 DB00637 DB12130 DB00648 DB15035 DB00794 DB11986 DB00977 DB12978 DB00451 DB10343 DB16648 DB00307 DB00495 DB00309 DB11963 DB01234 DB01223 DB12371 DB14443 DB12483 DB06772 DB08912 DB00444 DB00277 DB00312 DB00304 DB10317 DB06287 DB01229 DB00675 DB00503 DB09063 DB00570 DB14409 DB00220 DB01128 DB01590 DB08901 DB12147 DB00248 DB06626 DB00320 DB04855 DB00531 DB00625 DB11828 DB01396 DB11901 DB00530 DB01242 DB01254 DB13874 DB00563 DB08865 DB01174 DB08877 DB14685 DB10804 DB01420 DB12768 DB01227 DB05109 DB08896 DB09330 DB14568 DB00997 DB01118 DB11003 DB11703 DB12267 DB01320 DB08910 DB05294 DB00559 DB00834 DB00773 DB01323 DB11753 DB04845 DB09074 DB06442 DB01008 DB11730 DB00864 DB01418 DB06212 DB14631 DB00896 DB09289 DB14240 DB01181 DB00361 DB06603 DB16236 DB09143 DB01100 DB00575 DB06414 DB11641 DB00607 DB04868 DB06176 DB01248 DB08881 DB09054 DB06595 DB00877 DB00555 DB08827 DB00946 DB00908 DB05773 DB10318 DB00932 DB04572 DB06616 DB11050 DB00091 DB11363 DB00252 DB01045 DB00762 DB09073 DB06589 DB00696 DB00541 DB00872 DB01268 DB01201 DB08870 DB05239 DB00745","absorption":"Following subcutaneous administration, lenacapavir is slowly released but completely absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring at 84 days post-dose.

The two maturate variants of NK cells are CD56dim and CD56bright, which exert cytotoxicity through release of toxic chemicals and cytokine secretion, respectively. NK Cells express features of innate immune responses, and respond to all molecules that appear to be foreign to the body. \r\n\r\nThe most standard and utilized source of NK cells is directly from the peripheral blood of a donor through leukapheresis: a technique where immune cells are separated from red blood cells. Generally, the number of NK cells collected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) is too low for sufficient potency, and ex vivo expansion is performed. Expansion involves the use of feeder cell line systems or bioreactors to enhance the number of NK cells with desired cytotoxicity. These cells are also purified using cell-separation systems and processing.\r\n\r\nOther techniques involve using umbilical cord blood (UCB) directly; these NK cells have heterogeneous CD56 expression but are considered suitable for immunotherapy.

Although there are reports of a number of potential biological roles for TFF, currently, the exact mechanism of action is yet to be elucidated as cell surface receptors for TFFs have not yet been identified. However, a study proposes TFF2 to have a role in the negative regulation of interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor-mediated signalling.","drug-interactions":null,"absorption":null,"created":"2020-08-11","groups":"investigational","pathways":null,"snp-effects":null,"carriers":null,"half-life":null,"monoisotopic-mass":null,"volume-of-distribution":null,"route-of-elimination":null,"name":"Trefoil Factor 2","metabolism":null,"reactions":null,"indication":null,"ahfs-codes":null,"updated":"2020-08-13","drugbank-id":"DB15750"},{"toxicity":null,"snp-adverse-drug-reactions":null,"average-mass":null,"transporters":null,"pharmacodynamics":null,"msds":null,"description":"MRx-4DP0004 is a lyophilised formulation of the Bifidobacterium breve strain of commensal bacteria.

seasonally-specific component of the influenza vaccine. The influenza vaccine, also known as the \"flu shot\", is a vaccine that protects against infection from the influenza viruses. Vaccines provide protection from influenza by exposing the immune system to the virus (or parts of the virus) which stimulates an immunological defence against future exposure to the virus, or \"antigen\". This defence includes the production of humoral immunity through the development of antibodies (through memory B cells) and of cell-mediated immunity through the production of T-lymphocytes. Upon re-exposure to infectious influenza virus, the immune system is prepared to identify and destroy the virus as there are circulating antibodies that recognize that particular component of the virus that it was previously exposed to.\r\n\r\nThere are two basic types of vaccines available: inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Inactivated vaccines contain a virus particle that has been grown in media and then subsequently killed, or inactivated, through exposure to heat or chemicals such as formaldehyde 3. Inactivated virus cannot replicate, and therefore cannot cause disease from infection, even in immunocompromised individuals. In contrast, live vaccines are produced from \"wild-type\" or disease-causing viruses that have been attenuated, or weakened, through various laboratory techniques. Live vaccines maintain their replicative ability.","enzymes":null,"type":"biotech","cas-number":null,"sequences":null,"targets":null,"unii":"G1T4TD4PZC","protein-binding":null,"fda-label":null,"clearance":null,"atc-codes":null,"pdb-entries":null,"food-interactions":null,"state":null,"synthesis-reference":null,"mechanism-of-action":null,"drug-interactions":null,"absorption":null,"created":"2020-08-26","groups":"approved","pathways":null,"snp-effects":null,"carriers":null,"half-life":null,"monoisotopic-mass":null,"volume-of-distribution":null,"route-of-elimination":null,"name":"Influenza

The ability for mycobacterial antigens to reach the cytosol is due to this vaccine being engineered to secrete Hly which perforates phagosomal membranes. Because Hly is only active at an acidic pH, similar to listeriolysin O, the deletion of urease C was also beneficial for Hly to have optimal bioactivity in the phagosome.

Upon binding to its receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the S protein undergoes significant structural rearrangement to expose the hydrophobic fusion peptide that mediates membrane fusion and intracellular viral particle release.

Naxitamab may also cause severe neurotoxicity, including significant neuropathic pain, transverse myelitis, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), and ocular toxicities. Pain management should be implemented prior to and during therapy - patients should take a 12-day course of neuropathic pain prophylaxis (e.g. gabapentin) starting 4 days prior to infusion, and should receive oral opioids 45-60 minutes prior to infusion and intravenous opioids and\/or ketamine as needed thereafter.[L24454]","msds":null,"description":"Naxitamab (humanized 3F8, hu3F8) is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the oncofetal differentiation antigen GD2 disialoganglioside.[L24454,A224604] Normally expressed during fetal development and in mature neurons, pain fibers, and skin cells, GD2 constitutes a highly efficient target in the treatment of neuroblastoma - it is widely expressed across and within neuroblastomas (and other neuroectodermal tumors),[A224609] and is rarely subject to antigen loss.[A224604]\r\n\r\nThe first anti-GD2-monoclonal IgG antibody to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of neuroblastoma was [dinutuximab] under the brand name Unituxin in 2015.[A224474] One stark disadvantage of this therapy is the requirement for concurrent use of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA).[L24929]\r\n\r\nNaxitamab-gqgk (Danyelza) was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in November 2020 for the treatment of high-risk relapsed\/refractory neuroblastoma of the bone or bone marrow.[L24454] This approval requires naxitamab to be co-administered only with GM-CSF, a factor known to enhance the granulocyte-mediated antibody-dependent cytotoxicity of anti-GD2 therapies,[A224604] making the administration of naxitamab therapy markedly simpler than that of its predecessor.","enzymes":null,"type":"biotech","cas-number":"1879925-92-4","sequences":null,"targets":"BE0008624","unii":"9K8GNJ2874","protein-binding":null,"fda-label":null,"clearance":"The clearance of naxitamab appears to be correlated inversely with body weight.[L24454]","atc-codes":null,"pdb-entries":null,"food-interactions":null,"state":"liquid","synthesis-reference":null,"mechanism-of-action":"Neuroblastomas are neuroendocrine tumors occurring in immature and developing cells of the nervous system and are the most common malignancy diagnosed in children <1 year of age.[A224604] The GD2 disialoganglioside is a glycolipid found highly expressed on the surface of neuroectodermal tumors,[A224609] including neuroblastomas.

C1 inhibitor is a serine protease inhibitor that normally regulates bradykinin production by covalently binding to and inactivating plasma kallikrein.[A225121] \r\n\r\nPlasma kallikrein is a protease that cleaves high-molecular-weight-kininogen (HMWK) to generate cleaved HMWK (cHMWK).[L26661] During HAE attacks, the levels of plasma kallikrein fall, leading to the cleavage of high-molecular-weight-kininogen and the release of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator that increases vascular permeability. Bradykinin plays a major role in promoting edema and pain associated with HAE.[A225166,L26661] Patients with HAE cannot properly regulate plasma kallikrein activity due to the deficiency or dysfunction of a serum inhibitor of C1 inhibitor, leading to uncontrolled increases in plasma kallikrein activity and recurrent angioedema attacks.[L26661] Berotralstat is a potent inhibitor of plasma

Factor VIII is an essential protein involved in normal blood clotting; thus, a deficient level of functional factor VIII is associated with an elevated risk for excessive bleeding caused by spontaneous or secondary events like trauma or surgery.[A245149] Hemophilia A is the most common inherited bleeding disorder leading to deficiency of factor VIII, which is caused by defects in the F8C gene that encodes coagulation factor VIII. Bleeding in joints is a common manifestation of hemophilia A, and bleeding episodes can be severe and life-threatening like intracranial hemorrhage.[A245139] Rurioctocog alfa pegol aims to restore functional levels of factor VIII in patients with hemophilia A to manage and prevent bleeding episodes. It was first approved by the European Commission in January 2018.[L40119]\r\n\r\nRurioctocog alfa pegol is a covalent conjugate of [octocog alfa], which is a recombinant factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology from a Chinese hamster ovary cell line.
